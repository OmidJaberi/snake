# üêç Snake Implementations in Multiple Languages

Welcome to my **Snake game collection**!  

This repository features the classic Snake game implemented in several programming languages. Each version is designed to explore the **philosophy and structure** of the language while keeping the core gameplay intact.  

Currently, all implementations are **CLI-based**, but GUI versions may come in the future.

## üìö Learning Goals

This repository is not just about games; it's about **learning languages through practice**. By exploring Snake in multiple languages, you can:  

- Compare **syntax and design patterns**  
- See different approaches to common programming challenges  
- Practice translating **logic across languages**
